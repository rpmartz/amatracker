## Amatracker

Amatracker is a bare-bones iOS app for athletes to track their progress on the main barbell and olympic lifts. It was inspired by the gym logs at [CrossFit Amatak](http://crossfitamatak.com), the first registered CrossFit Affiliate in Cambodia.

### Suppored Devices

Amatracker is supported on iPhone 4 and above, and on iOS 8 and above.

### Features

#### Lifting Records

Amatracker is not trying to be a full-featured workout tracker. It's focused on tracking the barbell lifts. Users can select select their movements from a list of common movements:![Movement List](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ryan.martz/amatracker/calculator.png) Selecting a movement from the movement list will retrieve a list of records for that user, as well as the ability to add a new record:![Record List](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ryan.martz/amatracker/add-records.png)

Tapping on a record that was a one rep effort will bring up a list of percentages based on that weight:

#### Calculator

Amatracker also includes a one-rep max percentage calculator for convenience, so that if athletes know their one repeition maximum for a lift, they can conveniently get a list of percentages based off of that one rep max. ![Calculator](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ryan.martz/amatracker/calculator.png)

### Potential Future Enhancements

**Potential** future enhancements include:

* Pounds/kilograms conversion
* Export/backup capability
* Bodyweight to lift and lift to lift ratios (e.g. front squat to clean ratios)
